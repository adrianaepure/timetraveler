						<p>I have always been trapped inside certain time frames that either reminded me of my past memories or crossed my mind into imagining thrilling scenarios. Definetly, the hardest one to catch is the present one, to keep your mind focused inside this finite breath and to experience it fully.
						<br/>
						Photography has been giving me the opportunity to prolongue my feelings regarding time, has given me the chance to relieve the moments that have gone too fast from my life and I didn't get the chance to feel their complete meaning, but has also given me the freedom to play with shapes and light and imagine new universes that I'd like to travel to.
						<br/>If you're a traveler just like me, willing not only to travel through space, but also time please join my journey...
